# svg-gen

```warning
THIS LIBRARY IS NOT EVEN IN ALPHA VERSION YET!
```

A library to create, manipulate and animate svg via TypeScript (recommended) or JavaScript.

* zero dependencies
* type safe (*written in TypeScript for TypeScript*)
* let's you generate nice visual patterns
* is `NOT recomended` to use already - wait until it's stable!

## Install

```sh
npm install svg-gen
```

## Documentation

Is generated with `typedoc` and published in /docs. But it's not yet available online (no URL).

## Motivation

I had an UI idea for my new website which requires dynamic generation of triangle grids.
There are many JavaScript libraries to create svgs and probably some of them have TypeScript Declaration files, but I need extra functions anyway. And maybe one day this project turns into something useful for others as well.
