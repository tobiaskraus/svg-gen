# svg-gen

**WIP / I just started**

I want to create a small library (later available in npm) to create, manipulate and animate svg via TypeScript or JavaScript.

## Motivation

I had an UI idea for my new website which requires dynamic generation of triangle grids.
There are many JavaScript libraries to create svgs and probably some of them have TypeScript Declaration files, but I need extra functions anyway. And maybe one day this project turns into something useful for others as well.
